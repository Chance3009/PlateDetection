The dataset includes 607 images.
Plate are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -25 and +25 degrees
* Random shear of between -22째 to +22째 horizontally and -38째 to +38째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.84 percent of pixels
